# Data-Mining

One of my own projects to build up my skills on data science and machine learning. It's not complete yet. I'll work on doing a table join next.

1. Data Mining

Made use of location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. Made RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. Scraping web data and parsing HTML code. 

2. ETL & Feature Engineering

Utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate, explore and analyze the data. 

3. Data Visualization

Utilized Folium library to communicate results and findings
