# Data-Mining

One of my personal projects to build up my skills on data science and machine learning

1. Data Mining
Made use of location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. Made RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. Scraping web data and parsing HTML code. 

2. ETL & Feature Engineering
Utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate, explore and analyze the data. 

3. Data Visualization
Utilized Folium library to communicate results and findings
